Data is critical to any businessâ€™ success, but it is always an overwhelming process to extract meaningful insights. Power BI simplifies this data to insights cycle from both the adoption and cost perspective.

This is a presentation on a report compiled for the US DOT Air Travel Consumer Report. It contains record of 5.82 million commercial airline flights in 2015.

The insights generated provides information on the number of flights, airline, airport and canceled flights. It also provides figures and percentage of early departure, delayed departure and on time departure.

This could be useful in determining the most reliable airline, the reasons for flight cancelation, the overall flight volume by month and the average delay time in minutes.
